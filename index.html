        <p> A helping hand to a person shows how kind we are. Helping each other makes the world go round, and for
            centuries people have helped each other to live their lives. A society that has helped members is a Society
            that flourishes much faster than those which do not.</p>

                <h3> Blood for injury people</h3>
                <p>Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. If one of your blood
                    vessels gets damaged, it sends out signals to the platelets. The platelets then rush to the site of
                    damage and form a plug (clot) to fix the damage.

                    People are admitted to a hospital when they have a serious or life-threatening problem (such as
                    a heart
                    attack). They also may be admitted for less serious disorders that cannot be adequately treated
                    in
                    another place (such as at home or in an outpatient surgery center)

                <p>
                    This method has helped avoid a lot of accidents involving medicines in hospitals and other
                    healthcare
                    settings and can help you avoid accidents in your home as well. If you are in charge of giving
                    medications to someone you are caring for.
